This is a great guest post from _Bryan, from The Coffee Maven_, which was inspired by an earlier guest post – and provides some great tips for improving your Espresso.

Like most people who frequent this site, I drink an absurd amount of coffee. Part of that is because caffeine is my fuel of choice, but an even larger reason why I consume so much coffee is because I absolutely love it. A smooth, vibrant cup of coffee in the morning really sets the tone for a great day.



And the same goes for a bold espresso.

A few days ago I read a post here on Coffee Blog called “5 Ways to Up Your Coffee Game” providing several great tips for improving your daily cup.



In that post Matt Meinzer laid out the following five ways to make better coffee:

Drink fresher coffee with fresher beans

Grind before you brew

Brew differently (such as AeroPress or French Press)

Preheat your cup

Get your water right

In this post I want to follow up with another set of tips for you espresso drinkers out there.



And to keep it fresh — as Matt suggests! — I’ll come up with five new tips that you can use to take your espresso to the next level.

Water only brew



**1. Run a water-only cycle to preheat all components**

Water temperature is so crucial for espresso, and you’ll probably get slightly different suggested extraction temperatures across various online resources.



But one thing is for certain: A cold espresso machine will prevent your water from getting anywhere near the desired temperature range, giving you an under-extracted shot.



Use this awesome guide by Five Senses to dial in the temperature that suits your espresso style, and then make sure you run a water-only cycle to get all internal components preheated to the desired temperature.



However, you may want to leave the portafilter out if you don’t feel like you can quickly get it 100% dry before adding coffee for your actual shot.
